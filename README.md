## ⚡ Intelligence Overview
Neural Shadow is a high-fidelity cybersecurity dashboard designed for **Target Reconnaissance** and **Cloud Infrastructure Auditing**. By visualizing complex network topologies as interactive "Neural Maps," it allows operators to identify lateral movement paths and critical IAM vulnerabilities at a glance.



## 🛠️ Tactical Features
* **Ghost Matrix Engine:** Immersive UI with 80% watermark exposure of the core neural logo.
* **Lateral Recon Mapping:** Dynamic node visualization with multi-color risk indicators (Cyan/Yellow/Red).
* **Hexagram Targeting:** High-precision targeting markers for identified subdomains and API endpoints.
* **Neural Breach Intelligence:** Automated AI analysis of attack vectors and exfiltration paths.
* **Mission Archiving:** Instant export of tactical intelligence reports for bug bounty documentation.
