## ⚡ Overview
Neural Shadow is a high-intensity cybersecurity dashboard built for **Target Reconnaissance** and **Cloud Infrastructure Auditing**. By combining Python-based OSINT logic with a "Neural" AI Explainer, it maps attack surfaces in real-time and generates actionable intelligence reports.

## 🛠️ Tactical Specs
* **Ghost Matrix Engine:** Custom watermark branding with 80% visual exposure.
* **Intelligence Mapping:** Multi-color, multi-size node visualization using Hexagram markers to prioritize high-risk targets.
* **Neural Breach Explainer:** AI-driven logic that identifies SSRF, IAM misconfigurations, and lateral movement paths.
* **Tactical Export:** Instant generation of formal Intelligence Reports for bug bounty submissions.
